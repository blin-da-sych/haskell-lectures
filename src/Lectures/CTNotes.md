## **Category Theory**

### **Defenitions**

A **functor** is a structure preserving function.

A **morphism** is a structure-preservinig map between two mathimatical structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces).

*Question:* Are functors always morphisms? No. A functor is simply a structure preserving function. I don't have to specify a category containing a given functor for the functor to be useful, and for me to do things with it. Of course, in practice, we often do want to define a category whose morphisms are functors, because we are often interested in composite functors, but we don't need to do so.

```
In set theory morphisms are functions.
In linear algebra - linear transformations.
In group theory - group morphisms.
In topology - continuous functions.
```

A **concrete category** is a category that is equipped with a faithful functor to the category of sets (faithful functor - унивалентный функтор). A **faithful functor** (respectively a **full functor**) is a functor that is **injective** (respectively **surjective**) on hom-sets. <br />

In **Set Theory**, a **class** is a collection of sets (or sometimes other mathematical objects) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share. Classes act as a way to have set-like collections while differing from sets so as to avoid Russell's Paradox.
